- #### Fix location seeding scripts throwing error when there are too many source locations from the country config
  Locations are now seeded in smaller segments instead of one big collection. The newer approach has improved performance to a significant extent and also clears the interruption caused for a large number of country config locations

See [Releases](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/releases) for release notes of older releases.
