# OpenCRVS Dashboards

### Run in development mode

By default, Metabase is not started as part of the OpenCRVS stack as running it requires quite a bit of resources. You can use the following commands to use metabase in development:

`yarn start` â€“ Starts Metabase in port http://localhost:4444
`yarn db:shell` - Open a SQL shell for the database Metabase created
